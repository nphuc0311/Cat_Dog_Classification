# Cat_Dog_Classification
This project demonstrates image classification of cats vs. dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images, evaluated, and used for making predictions on new images.

# Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib Pillow tqdm
```

# Usage
* All training, testing, and prediction tasks are implemented in the code_test.ipynb file.
* The model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images and is used to predict new images.
